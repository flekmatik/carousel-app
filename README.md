# Carousel demo application

## Used dependencies
- **material-ui** - ui component library
- **axios** - HTTP client
- **typestyle** - CSS styling library
- **react-spring** - animation library

### Known issues
Backend endpoints have incorrect CORS configuration. Server configuration change needed. 

### Starting the app

`npm start` - site is served on http://localhost:3000

### Running tests

`npm test` - currently only JEST tests are implemented

Backend would need to be running for E2E functionality.

### Notes
- Due to trivial functionality no state management is deployed and data are saved in local state only.
